Blog Post 5: Elaborating on Game Mechanics – The Final Push of Red Rocket.

Finalising “Red Rocket”

With the finishing point of developing “Red Rockets” within sight, we focused on polishing the game and conducting extensive playtesting.
This phase is important in making sure that the game meets our desired vision and also provides an interesting experience which is challenging to the players.

Refining Gameplay
One of our main interests during this stage was to improve control and responsiveness of the game.
We went back to character movement mechanics, making slight changes for overall better feel.
Examples include a little tweaking on jump height, adjusting wall jump rate, and ensuring easy use of wall slides.
Our desire was to create a seamless experience, giving players’ total control so that they can execute accurate movements.

Updating Movement Mechanics
We further developed movement mechanics based on feedback from initial playtesting.
Among these improvements was increased character’s responsiveness during transition into things such as running, jumping and climbing walls.
The updates were very significant in keeping the fast-paced nature of the game while enabling easy and precise navigation through tough levels.

Level Design Improvements
A number of iterations were done on our level designs so as to offer a unique player experience.
For example, we introduced disappearing and appearing spikes so that gameplay would remain fresh throughout.
Each stage was meticulously constructed to be challenging yet fair with difficulty increasing steadily over time for player engagement purposes.

Visuals And Audio Enhancements
The visuals and audio elements were then enhanced in order to make it more immersive. 
We really worked hard in refining both character design plus environment’s looks using small details that make Red Rockets come alive.
Particle effects have also been integrated at lighting up its visual appeal whereas sound effects were tuned towards the game, thus creating an atmosphere that draws the player into the game’s world.

Testing and Feedback
Playtesting has been an integral part of this process. We conducted several rounds of tests with different players to gather their views on various aspects of the game.
This helped us identify some areas for improvement such as sudden jumps in difficulty, unexplained mechanics and visual glitches.
Several adjustments were made after receiving this feedback which ensured that players experienced a difficult yet fair gameplay.

Fixing Bugs And Optimising
On top of everything else, we also focused on addressing bugs as well as optimising performance.
Our development team worked with passion in fixing different issues that came up during playtesting like collision detection errors or frame rate drops. For instance, we optimised our games’ performance so that it runs smoothly over VIA Arcade Machine among others.
This was important in order to create a refined final product that could be enjoyed by players without any hindrances.

In summary,
Polishing and play testing Red Rocket has been a long yet fulfilling journey for us.
The quality and playability of the game have greatly improved due to changes implemented during this phase.
Now we are anxious to go into our final stages of development where we will share our complete product with our gamers.
