Executive Summary: Inspired by the challenging and fast-paced "Super Meat Boy," our game introduces unique features to the indie game genre. Designed for anyone looking for an engaging way to spend their free time, the game aims to captivate a broad audience with its accessible yet deep gameplay mechanics.

Gameplay: The gameplay will be similar to the game “Super meat boy” with some changes. There will be powerups and if it is collected by a player they will  have some powers to fly or drive. It will be a 2D game with multiple levels and the main objective is to get from point A to point B.

Mechanics: Wall jumps, double leaps, and boosts are ways for players to increase their range of motion. A random power-up, such as a car or rocket, is awarded upon collecting a consumable, which adds variants and strategy to the gameplay.
