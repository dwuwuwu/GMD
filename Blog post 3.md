Diving Deeper into Red Rocket's Development: Our GitHub Strategy


We are using GitHub to expedite our development process as we continue to work on Red Rocket, a game that draws inspiration from Super Meat Boy and Geometry Dash. All the magic happens in our project repository, which is available at https://github.com/iurg2002/GMD and allows for organized collaboration and progress tracking.

We've very carefully sorted all the game's assets, scripts, and resources into an organized order within our GitHub repository. GitHub is essential because it makes it simple for us to participate and navigate, which boosts output and promotes teamwork.

The gitignore file is essential to our setup.  Because it is customized for Unity's ecosystem, only necessary files are tracked, keeping the repository clear of clutter.

As Red Rocket evolves, our GitHub repository stands as a testament to our commitment to transparency and collaboration. It's not just a storage space; it's a dynamic environment where ideas are shared, refined, and brought to fruition.

We're in the midst of progress, and new obstacles and achievements arise every day. Our foundation is our GitHub setup, which helps us on our trip, records our advancements, and promotes an efficient workflow.

We enthusiastically welcome you to explore our repository, follow our development process, and maybe gain knowledge or ideas for future projects. Red Rocket is a cooperative project that showcases our enthusiasm, creativity, and the value of cooperation in the game production industry. It's more than just a game.

Stay tuned for further updates as we continue to shape Red Rocket, crafting an experience we hope will resonate with players and developers alike.
