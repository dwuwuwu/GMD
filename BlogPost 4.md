Blog Post 4: Conquering Difficulty – Pushing Through the Core Mechanics


As we went on with the development of "Red Rocket", we faced significant challenges when it comes to implementing the core mechanics which make it unique.
This part of game development was critical as it laid a foundation for the final shape of the game and concentrated on wall slides, jumps, wall jumps and other movement mechanics that so much characterise our gaming experience.

Wall Slides and Wall Jumps

The wall slide and wall jump were one of our main mechanics that we wanted to perfect.
These are instrumental in getting through levels filled with danger in “Red Rocket.”
For these mechanics to be incorporated accurately meant having collision detection systems that were on point and controls that were responsive.
At first, we had difficulties ensuring that the player characters would consistently respond to walls’ interaction.
We had to adjust physics engine so as to make sure that walls contacts registering and jumping off them correctly would maintain character’s natural feel momentum wise.

Jump Mechanics
Another thing was smooth incorporation of jump mechanic which is also very important.
The element needed not to interrupt flow but rather melt into gameplay freely.
During design process, this took creating multiple prototypes aimed at different jump heights and trajectories testing purposes.
Balancing these jumps so they effective but don’t break the game was a hard task. Testing many jumps helped us fine-tune them thus enriching game playability.

Movement Design
Another obstacle was making sure basic movement mechanics were challenging enough yet fair.
We wished to create tight responsive movements where players could perform precise hops or skills without any delay lag between what they do with their fingers on pads or keyboards and what happens on screens before them when playing platformer games like ours.
We constantly improved acceleration, deceleration as well as overall handling for character in order for him/her operate smoothly under satisfying control scheme.

Movement Mechanics
A significant part of our development was focusing on the movement mechanics.
We wanted the player’s movements to be fluid and responsive.
It involved tweaking the character’s acceleration, deceleration, and overall handling in a bid to create a satisfying control scheme.
This resulted in a set of movement mechanics that felt tight and responsive, allowing players to perform precise jumps and manoeuvres necessary for navigating our challenging levels.

Conclusion
Despite challenges encountered, it has been incredibly rewarding to successfully implement these core mechanics.
Each hurdle we overcame has brought us closer to the concept of “Red Rocket.”
This process developed our skills as developers making us understand how important it is not give up and keep improving what you have done over again when creating games.
We are excited about refining these mechanics more going forward and expect to present further progress with subsequent updates.
